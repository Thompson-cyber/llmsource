### RQ1
Code snippets generated by nine different LLMs using functional descriptions and method signatures. This includes 45,000 and 90,000 code files, respectively.
Clone results for codes generated by each LLM.


### RQ2
Detailed license information for each code snippet.

### RQ3
Issue Report on real GitHub project. 10 issue reports and 229 LLM generated codes.
Also include 2 repo codes and issue reports that developer deleted.
