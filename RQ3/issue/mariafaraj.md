Potential License Violation with ChatGPT Generated Code

**Description**: 

Hi ,I found a potential issue regarding license violation in the [perceptron.py](https://github.com/mariafaraj/CMSE202-f23-turnin/blob/main/hw-04/perceptron.py) . The[perceptron.py](https://github.com/mariafaraj/CMSE202-f23-turnin/blob/main/hw-04/perceptron.py) generated by ChatGPT may have been derived from another repository, leading to a violation of its license terms. Below are the details:

## Observations

The code [perceptron.py](https://github.com/mariafaraj/CMSE202-f23-turnin/blob/main/hw-04/perceptron.py) appears to have been generated by ChatGPT with [```Code generated by ChatGPT (GPT-4)```](https://github.com/mariafaraj/CMSE202-f23-turnin/blob/main/hw-04/perceptron.py#L1) comments.

However, the code from lines  6 to 39 seems to be a code clone with [patrickloeber/MLfromscratch](https://github.com/patrickloeber/MLfromscratch) repository and [perception.py](https://github.com/patrickloeber/MLfromscratch/blob/master/mlfromscratch/perceptron.py) file. The main difference between the two code snippets is the variable name and values. Additionally, the ChatGPT generated code was updated on **DEC/2/2023** and the cloned code was updated on **Jun/13/2021**.
https://github.com/mariafaraj/CMSE202-f23-turnin/blob/2f199df1314124083d106650c30de8af059d1cd4/hw-04/perceptron.py#L6-L39

There is no license for the ChatGPT-generated code in  perception.py and the repository. However, the cloned code is under [MIT](https://github.com/patrickloeber/MLfromscratch/blob/master/LICENSE) license.
According to the conditions of this  [MIT](https://github.com/patrickloeber/MLfromscratch/blob/master/LICENSE) license in line 12 :

>The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.

Due to the ChatGPT-generated code having no license and the cloned code being under the  [MIT](https://github.com/patrickloeber/MLfromscratch/blob/master/LICENSE) license, there may be a potential license violation. 

1. How do you view potential license conflicts between ChatGPT-generated code and existing open-source code?
2. Is there a potential license conflict between the [perceptron.py](https://github.com/mariafaraj/CMSE202-f23-turnin/blob/main/hw-04/perceptron.py)  and the   [perception.py in patrickloeber/MLfromscratch](https://github.com/patrickloeber/MLfromscratch/blob/master/mlfromscratch/perceptron.py) ?
3. If the license violation exists, would you add some explanation about the open-source licenses at the file level or repository level?

Thank you for your attention to this matter.
