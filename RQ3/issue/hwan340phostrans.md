**Description**: 

Hi ,I found a potential issue regarding license violation in the [phostrans](https://github.com/hwan340/phostrans) . The [discriminator_model Class in discriminator_model.py](https://github.com/hwan340/phostrans/blob/master/discriminator_model.py#L26) generated by Copilot may have been derived from another repository, leading to a violation of its license terms. Below are the details:

## Details

The code  [discriminator_model Class in discriminator_model.py](https://github.com/hwan340/phostrans/blob/master/discriminator_model.py#L26) appears to have been generated by GitHub Copilot with [```# All following code is generated by copilot```](https://github.com/hwan340/phostrans/blob/master/discriminator_model.py#L24) comments.

However, the code from lines  26 to 55 seems to be a code clone with [rish-16/CycleGANsformer](https://github.com/rish-16/CycleGANsformer) repository and [cyclegan.py](https://github.com/rish-16/CycleGANsformer/blob/main/cyclegansformer/cyclegan.py#L86) file. The main difference between the two code snippets is the variable name and values. Additionally, the Copilot generated code was updated on **Jun/30/2023** and the cloned code was updated on **Apr/12/2021**.
https://github.com/hwan340/phostrans/blob/09f98369660e31339e9f840fe3f7c7c57a7219f4/discriminator_model.py#L26-L56

There is no license for the Copilot-generated code in  discriminator_model.py and the repository. However, the cloned code is under [MIT](https://github.com/rish-16/CycleGANsformer?tab=MIT-1-ov-file#readme) license.
According to the conditions of this  [MIT](https://github.com/rish-16/CycleGANsformer?tab=MIT-1-ov-file#readme) license in line 12 :

>The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.

Due to the Copilot-generated code having no license and the cloned code being under the  [MIT](https://github.com/rish-16/CycleGANsformer?tab=MIT-1-ov-file#readme) license, there may be a potential license violation. 

1. How do you view potential license conflicts between Copilot-generated code and existing open-source code?
2. Is there a potential license conflict between the  [discriminator_model Class in discriminator_model.py](https://github.com/hwan340/phostrans/blob/master/discriminator_model.py#L26)  and the [cyclegan.py](https://github.com/rish-16/CycleGANsformer/blob/main/cyclegansformer/cyclegan.py#L86)?
3. If the license violation exists, would you add some explanation about the open-source licenses at the file level or repository level?

Thank you for your attention to this matter.
