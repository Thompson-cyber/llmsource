**Description**: 

Hi ,I found the code in  [createadminuser.py](https://github.com/caarmen/iou/blob/10494103ee7bb7237480c654bee0060c7555f693/iou/management/commands/createadminuser.py#L4) generated by ChatGPT may clone from another repository with  GPL license. Below are the details:

## Details

The ```Command``` class in  [createadminuser.py](https://github.com/caarmen/iou/blob/main/iou/management/commands/createadminuser.py)   appears to have been generated by ChatGPT with [```# This was generated by ChatGPT```](https://github.com/caarmen/iou/blob/main/iou/management/commands/createadminuser.py) comments.

However, the code from lines  7  to 21 seems to be a code clone with [create_user.py](https://github.com/City-of-Helsinki/smbackend/blob/42c46578a0196586c3cdba1a58ce8fe7002a1a18/observations/management/commands/create_user.py#L44) file in  [City-of-Helsinki/smbackend](https://github.com/City-of-Helsinki/smbackend) repository. The main difference between the two code snippets is the variable name and the code in createadminuser.py shorter than create_user.py.  Additionally, the ChatGPT generated code was updated on **OCT/30/2023** and the cloned code was updated on **AUG/24/2020**.
https://github.com/caarmen/iou/blob/10494103ee7bb7237480c654bee0060c7555f693/iou/management/commands/createadminuser.py#L7-L21

The  [createadminuser.py](https://github.com/caarmen/iou/blob/main/iou/management/commands/createadminuser.py) is under [MIT](https://github.com/caarmen/iou?tab=MIT-1-ov-file#readme). However, the cloned code is under [AGPL-3.0](https://github.com/City-of-Helsinki/smbackend?tab=AGPL-3.0-1-ov-file#readme) license.
According to the conditions of this AGPL-3.0 license, there may be a potential license violation.  :

>```
>You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
>produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
>terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
>a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and giving a relevant date.

1. How do you view potential license conflicts between ChatGPT-generated code and existing open-source code?
2. Is there a potential license conflict between the [createadminuser.py](https://github.com/caarmen/iou/blob/10494103ee7bb7237480c654bee0060c7555f693/iou/management/commands/createadminuser.py#L4) and the  [create_user.py](https://github.com/City-of-Helsinki/smbackend/blob/42c46578a0196586c3cdba1a58ce8fe7002a1a18/observations/management/commands/create_user.py#L44)?
3. If the license violation exists, would you add some explanation about the open-source licenses at the file level or repository level?

Thank you for your attention to this matter.
