**Description**: 

Hi ,I found the code in  [classification.py](https://github.com/ClosedAI469/Visual-Stimuli-Reconstruction-using-Multi-subject-fMRI-data/blob/main/classification.py) generated by ChatGPT may have been derived from another repository, leading to a violation of its license. Below are the details:

## Details

The ```train``` function in  [classification.py](https://github.com/ClosedAI469/Visual-Stimuli-Reconstruction-using-Multi-subject-fMRI-data/blob/main/classification.py)   appears to have been generated by Copilot with [```just a generic skeleton generated by Copilot```](https://github.com/ClosedAI469/Visual-Stimuli-Reconstruction-using-Multi-subject-fMRI-data/blob/main/classification.py#L16C11-L16C55) comments.

However, the code from lines  18  to 83 seems to be a code clone with [a_train_transfer_learning.py](https://github.com/linklab/link_dl/blob/e0d2b2b20382b6e3dcdd37cb7186c9a1253f7a5b/_01_code/_12_transfer_learning/a_train_transfer_learning.py#L96) file in  [linklab/link_dl](https://github.com/linklab/link_dl/blob/e0d2b2b20382b6e3dcdd37cb7186c9a1253f7a5b/_01_code/_12_transfer_learning/a_train_transfer_learning.py#L96) repository. The main difference between the two code snippets is the variable name. Additionally, the Copilot generated code was updated on **2024** and the cloned code was updated on **2023**.
https://github.com/ClosedAI469/Visual-Stimuli-Reconstruction-using-Multi-subject-fMRI-data/blob/978de8c45b9d38d01a8b878501f4cf44eb749dde/classification.py#L18-L83

The above code may clone the code from line [64 to line 128](https://github.com/linklab/link_dl/blob/e0d2b2b20382b6e3dcdd37cb7186c9a1253f7a5b/_01_code/_12_transfer_learning/a_train_transfer_learning.py#L64-L128).

There is no license for the Copilot generated code in classification.py and the repository. However, the cloned code is under [MIT](https://github.com/linklab/link_dl?tab=MIT-1-ov-file#readme) license.
According to the conditions of this MIT license :

>```
>The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all
>copies or substantial portions of the Software.
>```

Due to the Copilot generated code having no license and the cloned code being under the   [MIT](https://github.com/linklab/link_dl?tab=MIT-1-ov-file#readme) license, there may be a potential license violation. 

1. How do you view potential license conflicts between Copilot -generated code and existing open-source code?
2. Is there a potential license conflict between the [classification.py](https://github.com/ClosedAI469/Visual-Stimuli-Reconstruction-using-Multi-subject-fMRI-data/blob/main/classification.py) and the  [a_train_transfer_learning.py](https://github.com/linklab/link_dl/blob/e0d2b2b20382b6e3dcdd37cb7186c9a1253f7a5b/_01_code/_12_transfer_learning/a_train_transfer_learning.py#L96) ?
3. If the license violation exists, would you add some explanation about the open-source licenses at the file level or repository level?

Thank you for your attention to this matter.
