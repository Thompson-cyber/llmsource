# Potential License Violation with LLM-Generated Code

**Description**: 

Hi ,I found a potential issue regarding license violation in the [perceptron.py](https://github.com/sarahhoogstraten/CMSE202-f23-turnin/blob/main/hw-04/perceptron.py) . The [Perceptron Class](https://github.com/sarahhoogstraten/CMSE202-f23-turnin/blob/main/hw-04/perceptron.py#L6) generated by ChatGPT may have been derived from another repository, leading to a violation of its license terms. Below are the details:

## Observations

1. **LLM Generated Code**: The code  the [perceptron.py](https://github.com/sarahhoogstraten/CMSE202-f23-turnin/blob/main/hw-04/perceptron.py#L6) appears to have been generated by ChatGPT with ["Code generated by ChatGPT (GPT-4)"]() comments.

2. **Code Clone**: However, the code from lines  6 to 39 seems to be a code clone  with [patrickloeber/MLfromscratch](https://github.com/patrickloeber/MLfromscratch) repository and [perception.py](https://github.com/patrickloeber/MLfromscratch/blob/master/mlfromscratch/perceptron.py) file. The main difference between two code snippets is the variable name and values. Additionally, the ChatGPT generated code was update on **Nov/28/2023** and the cloned code was update on **Jun/13/2021**.

3. **License**

   - **LLM Generated Code License**: There is no license for the ChatGPT generated code in  [perception.py and the repository.
   - **Clone Code License**: The cloned code is under [MIT](https://github.com/patrickloeber/MLfromscratch/blob/master/LICENSE) license.

## License Conditions

According to the conditions of this  [MIT](https://github.com/patrickloeber/MLfromscratch/blob/master/LICENSE) license in line 12 :

>The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all
>copies or substantial portions of the Software.

Due to the ChatGPT-generated code having no license and the cloned code being under the  [MIT](https://github.com/patrickloeber/MLfromscratch/blob/master/LICENSE) license, there may be a potential license violation. 

## Questions/Solutions

1. How do you view potential license conflicts between ChatGPT-generated code and existing open-source code?
2. Is there a potential license conflict between the [perceptron.py](https://github.com/sarahhoogstraten/CMSE202-f23-turnin/blob/main/hw-04/perceptron.py#L6) and the   [perception.py in patrickloeber/MLfromscratch](https://github.com/patrickloeber/MLfromscratch/blob/master/mlfromscratch/perceptron.py) ?
3. If the license violation exists, would you add some explanation about the open-source licenses at the file level or repository level?

Thank you for your attention to this matter.
