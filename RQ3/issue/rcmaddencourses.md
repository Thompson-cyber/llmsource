Potential License Violation: ChatGPT-Generated Code and GPL-3.0 Cloned code in OOP_exercise.py

**Description**: 

Hi ,I found a potential issue regarding license violation in the [OOP_exercise.py](https://github.com/rcmadden/courses/blob/main/Ai-Programming-With-Python/fun_with_copilot/OOP_exercise.py#L92) . The [SalesPerson Class](https://github.com/rcmadden/courses/blob/main/Ai-Programming-With-Python/fun_with_copilot/OOP_exercise.py#L92) generated by ChatGPT may have been derived from another repository, leading to a violation of its license terms. Below are the details:

## Details

The code [OOP_exercise.py](https://github.com/rcmadden/courses/blob/main/Ai-Programming-With-Python/fun_with_copilot/OOP_exercise.py#L92) appears to have been generated by ChatGPT with [```The SalesPerson Class was generated by ChatGPT```](https://github.com/rcmadden/courses/blob/main/Ai-Programming-With-Python/fun_with_copilot/OOP_exercise.py#L4C3-L4C49) comments.

However, the code from lines  78 to 165 seems to be a code clone with [D-Bhatta/Udacity-AWS-ML-Foundations](https://github.com/D-Bhatta/Udacity-AWS-ML-Foundations) repository and [exercise.py](https://github.com/D-Bhatta/Udacity-AWS-ML-Foundations/blob/master/notebooks/exercise/exercise.py#L128) file. The main difference between the two code snippets is the variable name and values. Additionally, the ChatGPT generated code was updated on **Jan/30/2024** and the cloned code was updated on **Jul/14/2020**.

There is no license for the ChatGPT-generated code in  exercise.py and the repository. However, the cloned code is under [GPL-3.0](https://github.com/D-Bhatta/Udacity-AWS-ML-Foundations/blob/master/LICENSE) license.
According to the conditions of this  [GPL-3.0](https://github.com/D-Bhatta/Udacity-AWS-ML-Foundations/blob/master/LICENSE) license in line 195 :

> You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;

This means that if a developer uses GPL-3.0 protected code, they must include the same license. Since the ChatGPT-generated code has no license and the cloned code is under the [GPL-3.0](https://github.com/D-Bhatta/Udacity-AWS-ML-Foundations/blob/master/LICENSE) license, there may be a potential license violation 

1. How do you view potential license conflicts between ChatGPT-generated code and existing open-source code?
2. Is there a potential license conflict between the [OOP_exercise.py](https://github.com/rcmadden/courses/blob/main/Ai-Programming-With-Python/fun_with_copilot/OOP_exercise.py#L92) and the  [exercise.py in D-Bhatta/Udacity-AWS-ML-Foundations ](https://github.com/D-Bhatta/Udacity-AWS-ML-Foundations/blob/master/notebooks/exercise/exercise.py#L128)?
3. If a license violation exists, should some explanation about open-source licenses be added at the file level or repository level?

Thank you for your attention to this matter.
